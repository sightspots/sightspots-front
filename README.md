# SightSpots

SightSpots is an app prototype for tourism. Through a clean CMS, admins can create, modify and delete location entries for places of tourist interest (museums, religious buildings, parks...). These entries will appear both in the home page as location cards and in a world map as pins.

Each entry has its own view, which shows an image gallery, description and map location. In addition, there is the possibility to embed a Spotify player with a track related to the location. This may be an audio track describing the location or any other relevant sound piece.

Upon registration, users can share the locations, add them to their favorites list and "like" them. Faved locations appear on their profile page.

## Resources

The front end of the SightSpots project is made with React. Other core dependencies are:

- API calls to back end: Axios
- Map views: OpenLayers via rlayers
- Icons: FontAwesome
